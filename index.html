                  <p>
                      JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
                in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
                Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
                Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                JavaScript.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                      declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                      number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                      JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                      class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                      inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                      JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                      requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
                      loosely typed methods.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                      have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
                      be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                      you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                      function return types are not explicitly typed.

                  <p>
                  First, let me tell you why we code "helloworld".
                  Traditionally, Hello World programs are used to illustrate 
                  how the process of coding works, as well as to ensure that 
                  a language or system is operating correctly.They are usually 
                  the first programs that new coders learn, because even those 
                  with little or no experience can execute Hello World both 
                  easily and correctly.
                  </p>
                  
                      Now,open the Scratchpad and write your
                      first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                      <code>funtion greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                          greetMe("World");
                      </code>
                      Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                      browser!

                <p>
                  We use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                  names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                  dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                  JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                  "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                  You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                  identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                  _name.

              <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                  <code>let</code>,<code>const</code>,<code>var</code>
                </p>
                <p>Variable - For every iteration the value of the next property is assigned to the variable.</p>
                <p>iterable - An object that has iterable properties.</p>
                <p>
                  Example using <code>var</code>, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax can be used to declare both 
                  local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Example using <code>let</code>,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
                  can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                  below.
                  Variables defined with <code>const</code> behave like <code>let</code> variables, except they cannot be reassigned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                  always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                  warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>

              <article>
                <p>
                  When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                  global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                  current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
                  called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                  function.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                  rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
                  global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                  code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                  context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                  is an if statement.
                </p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>
                  This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                  ECMAScript 2015.
                </p>
    
                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                  defined</code>

              <article>
                <p>
                  You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
                  syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                  identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
                  can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                </p>
    
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>
                  A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                  while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
                  variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
                  represent a variable.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                  variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>
    
                <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                  CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                  }</code>
                However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
                is executed without problems.
                <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>

            <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
              <header>Data types</header>
              <article>
                <p>There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. They are:</p>
                <ul>
                      <li><code>String</code> represents textual data</li>
                      <li><code>Number</code> an integer or a floating-point number.</li>
                      <li><code>BigInt</code> an integer with arbitary precision.</li>
                      <li><code>Boolean</code> Any of two values: true or false.</li>
                      <li><code>undefined</code> a data type whose variable is not initialized.</li>
                      <li><code>null</code>denotes a <code>null</code>value.</li>
                      <li><code>Symbol</code> data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                      <li><code>Object</code>key-value pairs of collection of data</li>
                </ul>
                Here, all data types except <code>Object</code> are primitive data types, 
                whereas <code>Object</code> is non-primitive.
                <p class="note-tip">
                  <strong>Note: </strong>The <code>Object</code> data type (non-primitive type) can store 
                  collections of data, whereas primitive data type can only store a single data.
                </p>
                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
                to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
                are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that 
                your application can perform.

            <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">

              <article>
                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
                true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
                is false. An if statement looks as follows:
    
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                including further nested if statements.
                <p>
                  You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                  conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                  } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
                </code>
                In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
                evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
                them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
                to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
    
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                  statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                  statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                  statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
                It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
                because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
                the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
                assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
    
                <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

                A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
                evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
    
                <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
                statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                statement following the loop.
    
                <p>
                  The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
                  the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
                  tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
                  control is passed to the statement following while.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
                  those statements.
                </p>
    
                Example:
    
                <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
    
                <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
                <p>
                  With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                  Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
                </p>
    
                <ul>
                  <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                  <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                  <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                  true, so the loop terminates.
                </p>

              <article>
                A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
                statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
    
                <ul>
                  <li>The name of the function.</li>
                  <li>
                    A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                    separated by commas.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
                    brackets, { }.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
                </p>
    
                <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                <p>
                  The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
                  consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
                  function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                  specifies the value returned by the function.
                </p>
                <code>return number * number;</code>
                <p>
                  Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
                  value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
                  the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
                  the calling function.
                </p>

                Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, 
                each time with a different value.
                <ul>
                  <li>JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:</li>
                  <li>
                  <code>for</code>-loops through a block of code a number of times.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  <code>for/in</code>-loops through the properties of an object.  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  <code>for/of</code>-loops through the values of an iterable object.  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  <code>while</code>-loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  <code>do/while</code>-also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.  
                  </li>
              </ul>

                <li>The <code>break</code> statement "jumps out" of a loop.</li>
                <li>The <code>continue</code> statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.</li>
