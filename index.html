                      JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.
                  </p>

                    <li>
                      What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript language. So-called 
                      Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.APIs are ready-made sets of 
                      code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement.
                    </li>
                    <p class="note note notecard">
                    <strong>Browser APIs</strong> are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex things.
                    <strong>Third party APIs</strong> are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to grab their code and information from somewhere on the Web.

                    When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>,

                    inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in raw materials 
                    (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, 
                    via the Document Object Model API.

                  <p>
                      JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
                in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
                Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
                Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                JavaScript.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                      declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                      number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                      JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                      class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                      inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                      JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                      requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
                      loosely typed methods.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                      have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
                      be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                      you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                      function return types are not explicitly typed.

                  <p>
                  First, let me tell you why we code "helloworld".
                  Traditionally, Hello World programs are used to illustrate 
                  how the process of coding works, as well as to ensure that 
                  a language or system is operating correctly.They are usually 
                  the first programs that new coders learn, because even those 
                  with little or no experience can execute Hello World both 
                  easily and correctly.
                  </p>
                  
                      Now,open the Scratchpad and write your
                      first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                      <code>funtion greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                          greetMe("World");
                      </code>
                      Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                      browser!

                <p>
                  We use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                  names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                  dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                  JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                  "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                  You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                  identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                  _name.

              <header>Declaring variables</header>
              <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                  <code>let</code>,<code>const</code>,<code>var</code>
                </p>
                <p>Variable - For every iteration the value of the next property is assigned to the variable.</p>
                <p>iterable - An object that has iterable properties.</p>
                <p>
                  Example using <code>var</code>, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax can be used to declare both 
                  local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Example using <code>let</code>,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
                  can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                  below.
                  Variables defined with <code>const</code> behave like <code>let</code> variables, except they cannot be reassigned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                  always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                  warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
              <header>Variable scope</header>
              <article>
                <p>
                  When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                  global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                  current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
                  called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                  function.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                  rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
                  global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                  code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                  context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                  is an if statement.
                </p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>
                  This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                  ECMAScript 2015.
                </p>
    
                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                  defined</code>
                  <p><i>JavaScript's global scope is like a public toilet. You can't avoid going in there, but try to limit your contact with surfaces when you do.

                  <strong>Hoisting:</strong> Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior 
                    in which a function or a variable can be used before declaration.In hoisting, 
                    though it seems that the declaration has moved up in the program, the actual thing 
                    that happens is that the function and variable declarations are added to memory 
                    during the compile phase.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <u>Variable Hoisting</u>:
                    In terms of variables and constants, keyword <code>var</code> is hoisted and <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> does not allow hoisting.
                    In hoisting, the variable declaration is only accessible to the immediate scope.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <u>Function Hoisting</u>:
                    A function can be called before declaring it.However, when a function is used as an expression, 
                    an error occurs because only declarations are hoisted.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="note note notecard">
                  <strong>Note: </strong>Generally, hoisting is not performed in other programming languages like Python, C, C++, Java.
                  Hoisting can cause undesirable outcomes in your program. And it is best to declare variables and functions first 
                  before using them and avoid hoisting.
                  In the case of variables, it is better to use <code>let</code> than <code>var</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Recursion: </strong>Recursion is a process of calling itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.

                <p>
                  You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
                  syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                  identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
                  can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                </p>
    
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>
                  A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                  while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
                  variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
                  represent a variable.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                  variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>
    
                <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                  CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                  }</code>
                However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
                is executed without problems.
                <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>

              <header>Data types</header>
              <article>
                <p>There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. They are:</p>
                <ul>
                      <li><code>String</code> represents textual data</li>
                      <li><code>Number</code> an integer or a floating-point number.</li>
                      <li><code>BigInt</code> an integer with arbitary precision.</li>
                      <li><code>Boolean</code> Any of two values: true or false.</li>
                      <li><code>undefined</code> a data type whose variable is not initialized.</li>
                      <li><code>null</code>denotes a <code>null</code>value.</li>
                      <li><code>Symbol</code> data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                      <li><code>Object</code>key-value pairs of collection of data</li>
                </ul>
                Here, all data types except <code>Object</code> are primitive data types, 
                whereas <code>Object</code> is non-primitive.
                <p class="note note notecard">
                  <strong>Note: </strong>The <code>Object</code> data type (non-primitive type) can store 
                  collections of data, whereas primitive data type can only store a single data.
                </p>
                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
                to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
                are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that 
                your application can perform.

              <header>if...else statement</header>
              <article>
                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
                true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
                is false. An if statement looks as follows:
    
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                including further nested if statements.
                <p>
                  You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                  conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                  } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
                </code>
                In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
                evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
                them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
                to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
    
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                  statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                  statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                  statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
                It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
                because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
                the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
                assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
    
                <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

            <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
              <header>while statement</header>
              <article>
                A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
                evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
    
                <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
                statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                statement following the loop.
    
                <p>
                  The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
                  the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
                  tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
                  control is passed to the statement following while.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                  To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
                  those statements.
                </p>
    
                Example:
    
                <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
    
                <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
                <p>
                  With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                  Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
                </p>
    
                <ul>
                  <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                  <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                  <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                  true, so the loop terminates.
                </p>

              <article>
                A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
                statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
    
                <ul>
                  <li>The name of the function.</li>
                  <li>
                    A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                    separated by commas.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
                    brackets, { }.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
                </p>
    
                <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                <p>
                  The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
                  consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
                  function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                  specifies the value returned by the function.
                </p>
                <code>return number * number;</code>
                <p>
                  Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
                  value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
                  the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
                  the calling function.

                <code>Math</code> is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. 
                It’s not a function object.
                Math works with the Number type. It doesn't work with BigInt.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Unlike many other global objects, Math is not a constructor. All properties and methods of Math are static. 
                    You refer to the constant pi as Math.PI and you call the sine function as Math.sin(x), where x is the method’s argument. 
                    Constants are defined with the full precision of real numbers in JavaScript.
                  </li>
                  <p class="note notecard">
                    <strong>Note: </strong>Many <code>Math</code> functions have a precision that’s implementation-dependent.
                    This means that different browsers can give a different result. 
                    Even the same JavaScript engine on a different OS or architecture can give different results!</p>

              <article>
                Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, 
                each time with a different value.<strong> Loops are all to do with doing the same thing over and over again</strong>, 
                which is great for <strong>rapidly completing repetitive tasks</strong>.They generally have one or more following features:
                <ul>
                  <li>A <strong>counter</strong>, which is initialized with a certain value — this is the starting point of the loop.</li>
                  <li>A <strong>condition</strong>, which is a true/false test to determine whether the loop continues to run, or stops — usually when the counter reaches a certain value.</li>
                  <li>An <strong>iterator</strong>, which increments the counter by a small amount on each successive loop until the condition is no longer <code>true</code>.</li>
                  <li>JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:</li>
                  <li>
                  <code>for</code>-loops through a block of code a number of times.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  <code>for/in</code>-loops through the properties of an object.  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  <code>for/of</code>-loops through the values of an iterable object.  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  <code>while</code>-loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  <code>do/while</code>-also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

                    JavaScript is a bit confusing for developers experienced in class-based languages (like Java or C++), 
                    as it is dynamic and does not provide a <code>class</code> implementation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property which holds 
                    a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object 
                    is reached with <code>null</code> as its prototype. By definition, <code>null</code> has no prototype, and acts 
                    as the final link in this prototype chain.

                  <li><strong><u>Inherting properties</u>:</strong></li>
                  <li>JavaScript objects are dynamic "bags" of properties (referred to as own properties). JavaScript objects have a link to a prototype object. 
                    When trying to access a property of an object, the property will not only be sought on the object but on the prototype of the object, 
                    the prototype of the prototype, and so on until either a property with a matching name is found or the end of the prototype chain is reached.

                    <strong>Note:</strong>Following the ECMAScript standard, the notation <code>someObject.[[Prototype]]</code> is used to designate the prototype of <code>someObject</code>. 
                    Since ECMAScript 2015, the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> is accessed using the accessors <code>Object.getPrototypeOf()</code> and <code>Object.setPrototypeOf()</code>. 
                    This is equivalent to the JavaScript property <code>__proto__</code> which is non-standard but de-facto implemented by many browsers.
                    It should not be confused with the <code>func.prototype</code> property of functions, which instead specifies the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> to be assigned to all instances 
                    of objects created by the given function when used as a constructor. The Object.prototype property represents the Object prototype object.</p>

                  <p>
                    Strict mode isn't just a subset: it intentionally has different semantics from normal code. 
                    Browsers not supporting strict mode will run strict mode code with different behavior from browsers that do, 
                    so don't rely on strict mode without feature-testing for support for the relevant aspects of strict mode.

                    <li>Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics:</li>
                    <li>1) Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.</li>
                    <li>2) Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: 
                      strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.</li>
                    <li>3) Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.</li>

                    <li>Strict mode applies to entire scripts or to individual functions. 
                      It doesn't apply to block statements enclosed in <code>{}</code> braces; attempting to apply it to such contexts does nothing. 
                      <code>eval</code> code, <code>Function</code> code, event handler attributes, strings passed to <code>WindowTimers.setTimeout()</code>, 
                      and related functions are entire scripts, and invoking strict mode in them works as expected.</li>

              <article>
                <p>JavaScript typed arrays are array-like objects that provide a mechanism for reading and writing raw binary data in memory buffers.
                  This feature is well supported across all major browsers and with ES6, they were integrated into the core JS framework and received 
                  access to <code>Array</code> methods such as <code>map()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, etc.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Typed Arrays are implemented in such a way that they are structured as two main components. 
                    The two components that work hand-in-hand to implement typed arrays are the Buffer and View.</li>
                  <li><strong>Buffer:</strong> A Buffer is an object that is of type <code>ArrayBuffer</code> which represents a chunk of data. 
                    This chunk of raw binary data, cannot be accessed or modified on its own. You might wonder, what is the use of a data 
                    object which cannot be accessed or modified. Here is where a View comes into the picture.</li>
                  <li><strong>View:</strong> A View is an object that allows you to access and modify the raw binary content stored in an ArrayBuffer.</li>
                  <li>There are two kinds of Views:</li>
                  <li><strong><u>An instance of the <code>TypedArray</code> object</u>:</strong> These types of objects are much similar to the usual Arrays, 
                    but only store numerical data of a single type. Types like Int8, Uint8, Int16, Float32 are some of the TypedArray types. 
                    The number in the type denotes the number of bits allocated for the data type.</li>
                    <li><strong><u>An instance of the <code>DataView</code> object</u>:</strong> The <code>DataView</code> is a low-level interface that provides a getter/setter 
                      API to read and write arbitrary data to the buffer. This helps you immensely, especially when working with multiple data types in a single <code>TypedArray</code>.</li>
                      <li>Another advantage of using the <code>DataView</code> is that it lets you control the Endianness of your data. <code>Typed Array</code> use the Endianness of your platform. 
                        This will not be an issue if you are working locally, as your device will use the same Endianness as your typed array. In most scenarios, your typed array will be little-endian as Intel uses little-endian. 
                        Since Intel is very common amongst computer processors, there will not be an issue most of the time. But if you are transferring a little-endian encoded data to a device that uses big-endian encoding, 
                        you will end up with poorly encoded that will probably end up being corrupted. As <code>DataView</code> enables you to control the Endianness, you can use it whenever necessary.</li>

              <header>Memory Management</header>
              <article>
                <p>Low-level languages like C, have manual memory management primitives such as <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/" target="_blank">malloc() and free().</a>
                  In contrast, JavaScript automatically allocates memory when objects are created and frees it when they are not used anymore (garbage collection).</p>
                <ul><li>At the same time, JavaScript allocates memory when things (objects, strings, etc.) are created and “automatically” frees it up when they are not used anymore, 
                  a process called garbage collection.This seemingly “automatical” nature of freeing up resources is a source of confusion and gives JavaScript (and other high-level-language) developers the false impression 
                  they can choose not to care about memory management. This is a big mistake.</li>
                  <li>Even when working with high-level languages, developers should have an understanding of memory management (or at least the basics). Sometimes there are issues with the automatic memory management 
                    (such as bugs or implementation limitations in the garbage collectors, etc.) which developers have to understand in order to handle them properly (or to find a proper workaround, with a minimum trade off and code debt).</li>
                    <li>No matter what language you are using, memory life cycle is pretty much always the same.(Allocate -> Use -> Release)</li>
                    <li><strong>Allocate memory--</strong>memory is allocated by the operating system which allows your program to use it.</li>
                    <li>In low-level languages (e.g. C) this is an explicit operation that you as a developer should handle.</li>
                    <li>In high-level languages, however, this is taken care of for you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use memory--</strong>this is the time when your program actually makes use of the previously allocated memory. <strong>Read</strong> and <strong>Write</strong> operations are taking place as you’re using the allocated variables in your code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Release memory--</strong>ow is the time to release the entire memory that you don’t need so that it can become free and available again. As with the Allocate memory operation, this one is explicit in low-level languages.</li>

                    <li><u>Allocation via function cells</u>: Some function calls result in object allocation and Some methods allocate new values or objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Using memory in JavaScript</strong>: Using the allocated memory in JavaScript basically, means reading and writing in it.
                      This can be done by reading or writing the value of a variable or an object property or even passing an argument to a function.
                      Release when the memory is not needed anymore.The hardest task here is to figure out when the allocated memory is not needed any longer. 
                      It often requires the developer to determine where in the program such piece of memory is not needed anymore and free it.High-level languages 
                      embed a piece of software called garbage collector which job is to track memory allocation and use in order to find when a piece of allocated 
                      memory is not needed any longer in which case, it will automatically free it.</li>
                      <li>Most garbage collectors work by collecting memory which can no longer be accessed, e.g. all variables pointing to it went out of scope. 
                        That’s, however, an under-approximation of the set of memory spaces that can be collected, because at any point a memory location may still 
                        have a variable pointing to it in scope, yet it will never be accessed again.</li>
                        <li><h3>Garbage collection:</h3>Due to the fact that finding whether some memory is “not needed anymore” is undecidable, garbage collections 
                          implement a restriction of a solution to the general problem.</li>
                          <li><h4>Reference:</h4>The main concept that garbage collection algorithms rely on is the concept of reference. Within the context of memory management, 
                            an object is said to reference another object if the former has access to the latter (either implicitly or explicitly). For instance, a JavaScript 
                            object has a reference to its <a href="#Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain">prototype</a> (implicit reference) and to its properties values (explicit reference).
                            In this context, the notion of an "object" is extended to something broader than regular JavaScript objects and also contain function scopes (or the global lexical scope).</li>
                            <li><h4>Reference-counting garbage collection:</h4>This is the most naive garbage collection algorithm. This algorithm reduces the problem from determining whether or not an object 
                              is still needed to determining if an object still has any other objects referencing it. An object is said to be "garbage", or collectible if there are zero references pointing to it.</li>
                              <li><h4>Limitation-Circular references:</h4>There is a limitation when it comes to circular references. In the following example, two objects are created with properties that reference 
                                one another, thus creating a cycle. They will go out of scope after the function call has completed. At that point they become unneeded and their allocated memory should be reclaimed. 
                                However, the reference-counting algorithm will not consider them reclaimable since each of the two objects has at least one reference pointing to them, resulting in neither of them 
                                being marked for garbage collection. Circular references are a common cause of memory leaks.</li>
                                <li><h4>Mark-and-sweep algorithm:</h4> In order to decide whether an object is needed, this algorithm determines whether the object is reachable.</li>

                                <li><h4>Counter intuitive behavior of Garbage Collectors</h4>You can’t really tell when a collection will be performed. This means that in some cases 
                                  programs use more memory that it’s actually required. In other cases, short-pauses may be noticeable in particularly sensitive applications. 
                                  Although non-determinism means one cannot be certain when a collection will be performed, most GC implementations share the common pattern of 
                                  doing collection passes during allocation. If no allocations are performed, most GCs stay idle.</li>

              <header>Concurrency model and Event Loop</header>
              <article>
              <p>Javascript runtime is single threaded which means that it can execute one piece of code at a time.
                JavaScript has a concurrency model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. 
                This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.The following sections explain a theoretical model. Modern JavaScript engines implement and heavily optimize the described semantics.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Call Stack:</strong> A call stack is a simple data structure that records where in the code we are currently. So if we step into a function that is a function invocation it is pushed to the call stack. 
                  When we return from a function it is popped out of the stack.</li>
                  <li><strong>Browser:</strong> Now we know from this that Javascript can execute one thing at a time but that’s not the case with the Browser. The Browser has its own set of APIs like setTimeout and XMLHttpRequests 
                    which are not specified in the Javascript runtime.In fact if you look through the source code of V8, the popular Javascript runtime that powers browsers like Google Chrome, you won’t find any definitions for it. 
                    That's because these special web API’s exist in the browser environment not inside the javascript environment. So you can say that these APIs introduce concurrency into the mix.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heap:</strong> It’s mostly the place where objects are allocated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call back Queue:</strong> It’s a data structure that stores all the callbacks. Since it’s a queue, the elements are processed based on First in First Out(FIFO).At some point during the event loop, 
                      the runtime starts handling the messages on the queue, starting with the oldest one. To do so, the message is removed from the queue and its corresponding function is called with the message as an input parameter. 
                      As always, calling a function creates a new stack frame for that function's use.The processing of functions continues until the stack is once again empty. Then, the event loop will process the next message in 
                      the queue (if there is one).</li>
                      <li><strong>Event loop:</strong> The main function of event loop is to check the program stack and find if it is empty. If the stack is empty, then it checks the callback queue. If the callback queue is not empty 
                        then it pushes the code block from callback queue to main stack and executes it sequentially.</li>

                        <p>Now lets try to understand what is happening when the above program is getting executed.</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>1. The program execution starts. Since Javascript is single threaded only 1 line can be executed at a time.</li>
                          <li>2. So, First line of code is pushed onto stack.</li>
                          <li>3. The console.log is executed printing "Hello". So this line is now popped out of stack.</li>
                          <li>4. Now next line to be executed is setTimeout and it gets pushed onto stack. Now the javascript runtime can only execute single statement but the browser comes with a whole lot of other things which are web apis. 
                            This is when concurrency comes into picture. Now on the execution of setTimeout, a call to setTimeout api is made and the setTimeout is now popped of from stack.</li>
                          <li>5. The third statement is pushed onto stack and then executed. This prints "Bye" as output.</li>
                          <li>6. Now when the setTimeout api ( and all other apis ) are completed, the callback is pushed into callback queue simultaneously. These apis cannot interact directly with the stack.</li>
                          <li>7. Now is the time when event loop comes into picture. Event loops jobs is to monitor call stack and task queue. If the call stack is empty, it has to take the first thing from the callback queue and push 
                            it onto the stack. So now callback from the timeout is pushed onto the stack which then gets executed and prints "Hello inside setTimeout".</li>
                        </ol>
